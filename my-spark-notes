Spark notes:

Even during node failures, the narrow dependency operation only recomputes the missing partition of the parent node, while in the case of wide dependency, all the dependent partitions of the parent RDD are recomputed.

However, the fold() function also requires a zero value that is utilized while initializing the call to the partitions for the RDD. Depending on the type of aggregate function the zero value should ideally change , such as while adding the values of RDD elements zero value can be 0, similarly while multiplying it can be 1 and while concatenating a string it could be a blank space. 

DataSet vs DataFrame in spark 1.6 and 2.*
   This is a short description of how case classes and the objects of case classe work with dataframe and dataset.
